Predicate documentation
-----------------------

The header of the documentation of a predicate consists of one or more
_templates_, each defining a specific way of calling the predicate:

==
<template>       ::= <head>['//'] 'is' <determinism> | <head>['//']
<determinism>    ::= 'det' | 'semidet' | 'failure' | 'nondet' | 'multi'
<head>           ::= <functor>'('<args>')' | <functor>
<args>           ::= <argspec>',' <args> | <argspec>
<argspec>        ::= [<instantiation>]<argname>[':'<type>]
<instantiation>  ::= '+' | '-' | '?' | ':' | '@' | '!'
<type>           ::= <term>
==

The meaning of the _determinism_ modes is:

| *Determinism* | *Predicate behaviour* |
| =det=     | Succeeds exactly once. |
| =semidet= | Fails or succeeds exactly once. |
| =failure= | Always fails. |
| =nondet=  | Fails or succeeds one or more times. |
| =multi=   | Succeeds one or more times. |

The meaning of the argument _instantiation_ modes is:

| *Instantiation* | *Direction* | *Argument requirements* |
| =|+|= | Input argument  | Must satisfy _type_ at call time.  May be instantiated further. |
| =|-|= | Output argument | Must be unbound at call time.  Will satisfy _type_ on exit. |
| =|?|= | Output argument | As =|-|= but "steadfast".  (With =nonvar= argument, =det= becomes =semidet=, etc.) |
| =|:|= | Input argument  | As =|+|= but treated as a meta-argument. |
| =|@|= | Input argument  | As =|+|= but not instantiated further. |
| =|!|= | Input argument  | As =|+|= but may be modified destructively. |

*NOTE*: The result of calling a predicate with incorrectly instantiated
arguments is _undefined_ and may include errors and unexpected behavior.
